title: ComicRack's ComicInfo.xml
---

## What is it?

The `ComicInfo.xml` file originates from the **ComicRack** application, which is not developed anymore.
The `ComicInfo.xml` however is used by a variety of applications.

There is, however, no governance about the file format, until now!

The goals of this initiative are to:

1. document the existing versions of the schema, with the accepted usage of each field
2. centralize, discuss, and document evolutions of the schema
