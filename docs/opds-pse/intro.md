# What is it?

The OPDS Page Streaming Extension (OPDS-PSE) is an **_unofficial_** extension of
the [Open Distribution Publication System](https://specs.opds.io/opds-1.2). Its goal is to enrich the OPDS feed with
information allowing the client to request a specific page of a document without having to download it completely.

This extension was designed primarily for comic books, to allow reading them on connected devices without having to wait
for the book to be completely downloaded.

## History

Recently more applications started implementing the extension, with more features than Ubooquity had.

We decided to bring the OPDS Page Streaming Extension under the umbrella of the Anansi Project, in order to add more
features to the specification. We created a GitHub repository to host the different versions of the specification, and
to make it an open place for everyone to discuss and contribute.

## Credits

The original 1.0 specification has been created by Tom for Ubooquity, and can be found
