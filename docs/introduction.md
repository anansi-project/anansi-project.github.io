# What is The Anansi Project?

The Anansi Project is a collection of software initiatives around comics & books.

## Initiatives

At the moment, the Anansi Project comprises 3 initiatives:

- [OPDS Page Streaming Extension](opds-pse/intro)
- [the ComicInfo metadata format](comicinfo/intro)
- target metadata model for comics & books

## A bit of history

The Anansi Project was started in August 2021 by gotson, the developer of Komga. The initial aim was to gather feedback
and comments around comicbook metadata: the different formats and their limitations, the websites publishing metadata,
and start discussing a new metadata model that would address all the griefs from existing solutions.

A lot of feedback was gathered, and a new data model has been drafted, but time being a scarce resource, this is still a
work in progress.

In December 2021, following a request by a Komga user to enhance the OPDS feed, gotson decided to make some changes to
the OPDS Page Streaming Extension. The 1.0 specification was written in 2014 for Ubooquity, but is now used by many
application. Ubooquity was already inactive for a couple of years, so changing the specification would mean publish it
somewhere. gotson already had a mirror of the 1.0 specification, in case the original page would suddenly go down.
That's when the idea came to bring the OPDS PSE specification under the Anansi Project.

With OPDS PSE under a new home, it was obvious that we should also bring the ComicInfo schema specification under the
Anansi Project umbrella too. gotson teamed up with majora2007, the developer of Kavita, to bring all of this together.
